# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This code helps in detecting breast cancer.

Predicting the breast cancer using Machine learning

Breast Cancer predicting with Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree Classifier model, Random Forest Classifier model, Naive Bayas classifier model, SVM model

I will compare different machine learning model to see what would provide the best classification results in differentiating malignant tumors from benign tumors.

Using data set from : https://www.kaggle.com/lbronchal/breast-cancer-dataset-analysis

Using tool : Jupyter Notebook
